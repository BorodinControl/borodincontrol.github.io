                    Prospero Burns is the latest book I have read in the Horus Heresy series, and it was in turn the very book that got me into reading these books to begin with. 
                    While watching a review on youtube I was transfixed by the many quirks that make up that we first come to know as Ahmad Ibn Rustah.

                    The fact that he is referred to by many names is only the start of his bizarre backstory, and I resolved then and there that I could do no justice to 
                    his character without understanding his nature, motivations and place within the greater 30k universe as it was written in his book.

                    I was duely satisfied with the answers when I finally got to this book after fourteen others, although for a beginner to Warhammer 40,000/30,000, 
                    I would recommend a simpler book to start out with, such as Descent of Angels.
