                    For those of you familiar with the movie Trainspotting, I would say it turns out that the movie is extremely faithful to the source material. 
                    Some characters are merged or omitted by the screenplay, but altogether, the book is pretty much just a deep dive into what I had already seen, and for fans, 
                    this is amazing. The book is kind of better because it's like a 4+ hour extended edition of the movie, and you get to see what happens in between the movie 
                    scenes (for example, his walk of shame after the worst toilet in Scotland). What movie fans may be surprised by 
                    is how much less sympathetic the main character is.
                </p>
                <!-- This is another paragraph -->
                <p>
                    However, I knew what Renton is like in the movie and he is the type of person that you dislike the more you hear their twisted thoughts.
                </p>
                <!-- This is a third paragraph -->
                <p>
                    Movie fans are treated by a few first person POV chapters from the other characters as well, including Begbie, Sick Boy and Spud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very entertaining to try and see what they're actually thinking when all of this is going on. I would definitely recommend it.
