                    At book number fourteen of the Horus Heresy series, I would say this is up there as one of my favorite books, if not the favorite. 
                    This is hardly faint praise, as in my opinion there hasn’t been a book that I do not like in the series, even the much-derided Battle for the Abyss.

                    The First Heretic has also had its fair share of shade thrown at it by a popular YouTube reviewer by the name of Arch Warhammer, and I find the vast 
                    majority of his criticisms to be not only pedantic but a demonstration that he did not understand the plot or the lore of the Word Bearers traitor legion.
                </p>
                <!-- This is a third paragraph -->
                <p>
                    The main character that we follow around for the majority of the story is a space marine of the legion’s Serrated Suns chapter, and rather than being 
                    the carbon copy of Garviel Loken as I expected, Argel Tal is not only one of the most unique protagonists so far, but arguably an even more compelling one 
                    than his counterpart in the Sons of Horus.
