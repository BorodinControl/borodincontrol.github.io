                        My lone runs are becoming sparser, as the UAlbany Running Exchange has begun meeting again. It makes me happier to encounter some familiar faces and my running 
                        intensity has increased, but as this group rarely does more than six miles together my total distance has taken a nosedive. Still, with some exceptions I have 
                        continued to work out twice every weekday and once every weekend. This Saturday was spent in Colonie, so I have elected to give my route between my office and 
                        the airport another shot. I have also decided to continue A Game of Thrones. Mostly, I have encountered a number of plot segments that are quite similar to those 
                        in the TV show. However, I can rest assured in the knowledge that the writers for HBO are unlikely to botch these characters too much.

                    Today, I felt a bit out of sorts with the recent changes in lighting, and therefore, for my nightly run, I decided to attempt a new running route and a new 
                    book to accompany it. I ran from my house, over the bridge and past the thruway, turning on various streets to bring my total distance up to 10.66 miles. 
                    This route is quite enjoyable during the night, and surprisingly safe. I may even enjoy it during the winter. I decided on a change in books as well, 
                    switching to A Game of Thrones. George RR. Martin is notorious for his story length, therefore although this is quite a time commitment. 
                    I will probably break this up piecemeal with other books, as I have done with the Mahabharata.
